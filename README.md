# blocklock-agent

[![Build Status](https://github.com/randa-mu/blocklock-agent/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/randa-mu/blocklock-agent/actions/workflows/build.yml)

`blocklock-agent` is a blockchain-based timelock decryption and signature agent that uses BLS cryptography and the Blocklock protocol on the Ethereum-compatible Filecoin network. It listens for on-chain `DecryptionRequested` events and responds based on cryptographic criteria.

> **Note**: You **do not need to run your own node**. The [**dcipher network**](https://docs.randa.mu) operates trusted `blocklock-agent` instances on supported chains, and can fulfill requests on your behalf.

> If you want to run your own agent in **production**, you must:
> - Use your own **BLS private key** (do _not_ reuse any defaults!)
> - Deploy the required smart contracts from [**blocklock-solidity**](https://github.com/randa-mu/blocklock-solidity)
> - Pass your BLS **public key** to the deployed contracts so they can verify your agent‚Äôs responses.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **State Persistence**: Persists last processed block and request ID to disk.
- üì° **Health Endpoint**: Exposes HTTP endpoint for readiness/health probes.
- üîÑ **Event Replay**: Replays unfulfilled past requests upon restart.
- üßÆ **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests fulfilled per block.

## Configuration

You can configure `blocklock-agent` using CLI flags or environment variables:

## Usage

Run the agent:

```bash
npm run start [options]
```

Example:

```bash
npm run start \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --state-path ./state.json \
  --rate-limit 3
```

If no state file exists, the agent begins at the current block height. A sample state file format is:

```json
{ "chainHeight": 123456 }
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Startup**:
   - Connects to the blockchain using the configured RPC
   - Loads cryptographic keys and config
   - Reads `state.json` to determine where to resume processing
   - Queries past `DecryptionRequested` events from the last known block
   - Begins polling for new events

2. **Decryption Handling**:
   - For each request:
     - Verifies that the scheme is supported (`BN254-BLS-BLOCKLOCK`)
     - Computes a BLS signature over the request condition
     - Submits a fulfillment via `DecryptionSender`

3. **State Persistence**:
   - Saves the latest processed block height and request ID to `state.json` to ensure replay safety

4. **Health Endpoint**:
   - HTTP server responds on the configured port to report liveness/health

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Ensures that only a limited number of requests are fulfilled per block (useful for gas control)

## Testing

To test locally:

1. Start a local chain like [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/)
2. Deploy `DecryptionSender`, `BlocklockSender`, and any relevant user contracts
3. Emit `DecryptionRequested` events to simulate activity

See [blocklock-solidity](https://github.com/randa-mu/blocklock-solidity) for contract setup and example scripts.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`missing revert data`**:
  - Check the RPC URL, private key, contract address, and ciphertext validity
  - Refer to this [example script](https://github.com/randa-mu/blocklock-solidity/blob/main/scripts/chain-interaction.ts)

- **Unhandled Exception**:
  - Ensure the blockchain node is accessible
  - Confirm that the start block exists and the chain isn‚Äôt pruned
